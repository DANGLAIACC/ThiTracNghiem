The EC2 instances running in private subnets of a VPC can have access to S3 buckets, objects, and API functions that are in the same Region as the VPC by using the S3 gateway endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the steps to set up a gateway endpoint:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2015/vpc_config_endpoint_5.png"></p>\n\n<p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2015/vpc_config_endpoint_routes_2.png">\nvia - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-endpoint-for-amazon-s3/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-endpoint-for-amazon-s3/</a></p>\n\n<p>Important Characteristics for S3 Gateway Endpoints:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-ans-pt/assets/pt2-q18-i1.jpg">\nvia - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html</a></p>\n\n<p>You can further use an S3 bucket policy to indicate which VPCs and which VPC Endpoints have access to your S3 buckets.</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-ans-pt/assets/pt2-q18-i2.jpg">\nvia - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up an Origin Access Identity (OAI) for the S3 bucket and allow access only from within the VPC</strong> - Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used within the context of CloudFront.

Endpoints are virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.</p>\n\n<p>VPC endpoints enable you to reduce data transfer charges resulting from network communication between private VPC resources (such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute—or EC2—instances) and AWS Services (such as Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB). Without VPC endpoints configured, communications that originate from within a VPC destined for public AWS services must egress AWS to the public Internet in order to access AWS services. This network path incurs outbound data transfer charges. Data transfer charges for traffic egressing from Amazon EC2 to the Internet vary based on volume. With VPC endpoints configured, communication between your VPC and the associated AWS service does not leave the Amazon network. If your workload requires you to transfer significant volumes of data between your VPC and AWS, you can reduce costs by leveraging VPC endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>In larger multi-account AWS environments, network design can vary considerably. Consider an organization that has built a hub-and-spoke network with AWS Transit Gateway. VPCs have been provisioned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate network isolation or to enable delegated network administration. When deploying distributed architectures such as this, a popular approach is to build a "shared services VPC, which provides access to services required by workloads in each of the VPCs. This might include directory services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instead of building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost.</p>\n\n<p>Centralized VPC Endpoints (multiple VPCs):\n<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-ans-pt/assets/pt2-q19-i1.jpg">\nvia - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Transit VPC to reduce cost and share the resources across VPCs</strong> - Transit VPC uses customer-managed Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) VPN instances in a dedicated transit VPC with an Internet gateway. This design requires the customer to deploy, configure, and manage EC2-based VPN appliances, which will result in additional EC2 instances, and potentially third-party product and licensing charges. Note that this design will generate additional data transfer charges for traffic traversing the transit VPC: data is charged when it is sent from a spoke VPC to the transit VPC, and again from the transit VPC to the on-premises network or to a different AWS Region. Transit VPC is not the right choice here because it\'s not cost-optimal for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p>More on Transit VPC:\n<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-ans-pt/assets/pt2-q19-i2.jpg">\nvia - <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Fully meshed VPC Peers</strong> - This approach creates multiple peering connections to facilitate the sharing of information between resources in different VPCs. This design connects multiple VPCs in a fully meshed configuration, with peering connections between each pair of VPCs. With this configuration, each VPC has access to the resources in all other VPCs. Each peering connection requires modifications to all the other VPCs’ route tables and, as the number of VPCs grows, this can be difficult to maintain. And keep in mind that AWS recommends a maximum of 125 peering connections per VPC. It\'s complex to manage and isn\'t the right fit for the current scenario.</p>\n\n<p>More on Fully meshed VPC Peers:\n<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-ans-pt/assets/pt2-q19-i3.jpg">\nvia - <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPCs connected with AWS Direct Connect</strong> - This approach is a good alternative for customers who need to connect a high number of VPCs to a central VPC or to on-premises resources, or who already have an AWS Direct Connect connection in place. This design also offers customers the ability to incorporate transitive routing into their network design. For example, if VPC A and VPC B are both connected to an on-premises network using AWS Direct Connect connections, then the two VPCs can be connected to each other via AWS Direct Connect. Direct Connect requires physical cables and takes about a month for setting up.

SSL encrypts communications between client and server to safely send messages.</p>\n\n<p>When you use HTTPS or SSL for your front-end listener, you must deploy an SSL certificate on your load balancer. The load balancer uses the certificate to terminate the connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the instances.</p>\n\n<p>If you set up HTTPS/SSL on the back-end connection, you can optionally set up authentication of your instances. When you set up back-end instance authentication, you create a public key policy. Next, you use this public key policy to create a back-end instance authentication policy. Finally, you set the back-end instance authentication policy with the instance port for the HTTPS protocol. However, you should note that this is not an SSL passthrough.

QoS technologies accomplish this by providing differentiated handling and capacity allocation to specific flows in network traffic. Bandwidth (throughput), latency (delay), jitter (variance in latency), and error rate are the metrics relevant to QoS. This implies that QoS is of particular importance to high-bandwidth, real-time traffic such as voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and video-on-demand that have a high sensitivity to latency and jitter.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the promiscuous mode allows the user to bypass the normal operation mode by forwarding all traffic it receives to the CPU. However for AWS, even if you can turn your NIC to Promiscuous mode, the hypervisor will never pass traffic intended for another virtual machine to your EC2 instance. You need to use traffic mirroring as it allows you to copy traffic passing through an elastic network adaptor and send it toward another instance for further investigation. For the given use case, you need to set up traffic mirroring on the source EC2 instances hosting the VOIP program and then install a network monitoring program (such as Wireshark) on the traffic mirroring target EC2 instance. Finally, you can stream the logs from the target EC2 instance to an S3 bucket for further analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use CloudWatch to inspect the network packets</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. CloudWatch cannot be used to inspect the network packets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPC Flow Logs to inspect the network packets</strong> - VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in that subnet or VPC is monitored. VPC Flow Logs cannot be used to inspect the network packets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision another EC2 instance with an ENI added to act as a monitoring interface. Configure the port to <code>promiscuous mode</code> and sniff the traffic to analyze the packets. Direct the output of this single stream to an S3 bucket for further analysis</strong> - Amazon EC2 instances running with an Amazon VPC have built-in protection against packet sniffing. It is not possible for a virtual instance running in promiscuous mode to receive or “sniff” traffic that is intended for a different virtual instance. While customers can place their interfaces into promiscuous mode, the hypervisor will not deliver any traffic to them that is not addressed to them. Even two virtual instances that are owned by the same customer located on the same physical host cannot listen to each other’s traffic. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/Networking_Security_Whitepaper.pdf">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/Networking_Security_Whitepaper.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/@macsat101/packet-sniffing-using-wireshark-on-aws-183b7983685d">https://medium.com/@macsat101/packet-sniffing-using-wireshark-on-aws-183b7983685d</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quality-of-service-qos">https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quality-of-service-qos</a></p>\n', 'answers': ['<p>Configure traffic mirroring on the source EC2 instances hosting the VOIP program, set up a network monitoring program on a target EC2 instance and stream the logs to an S3 bucket for further analysis</p>', '<p>Use CloudWatch to inspect the network packets</p>', '<p>Use VPC Flow Logs to inspect the network packets</p>', '<p>Provision another EC2 instance with an ENI added to act as a monitoring interface.
